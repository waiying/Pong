# Pong
This is my first Unity game project created in June 2016. It is your classic Pong game with 2-player features and music selection.

To install Pong on your Android, simply download the Pong.apk file to your device and install.
If you want to open Pong in Unity3D, make sure to download the whole Pong folder and select the folder to open in Unity.
